# Test-Filters

React test for filtering table data

## Installation

Use standard npm for package management

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
## Task Description

### Make a filtering logic.

* Render people's array into RecortTable. Columns should contain Name and DOT accordingly 
* If Name field is checked the items in <RecordTable> should be filtered alphabetically ascending from a-z. 
* If Age field is checked the items in <RecordTable> should be filtered by age in a descending manner (ascending by date of birth).
* The user can't have both of those optiones checked at the same time. So it should work similar to Radio Buttons.
